## Lab Intro

Welcome to your first lab in Bayesian Analysis. You're probably thinking that you've fallen down in a really deep rabbit hole. Fear not, this weekâ€™s lab is all about equipping you with the tools you need to get a good grasp of the issues surrounding Bayes, and will position you to understand deeper computing with Bayes for the rest of the week. Let's begin!

## Exercise

As we saw in the lesson, building Bayesian models will require us to use common probability models for the likelihood function. These will include: binomial, Bernoulli, Cauchy, chi-squared, and poison distributions. Since we've spent the past few weeks working on machine learning applications, in this lab we'll review some statistics fundamentals using Python.

| Distribution  | Probability Mass Function (The Formula)  | Written Description 
|:-:|---|---|
| Uniform  | ![](./assets/images/uniform.png) | A uniform distribution is utilized when you're selecting any one member of a set is just as likely as any other  |
| Bernoulli   | ![](./assets/images/bern.png) | Like a coin flip, p represents the probability that event X occurs, and 1-p is the probability that event Y occurs  |
| Poisson | ![](./assets/images/poisson.png) | The probability of observing x events in a certain time interval. e is the Euler number and n is a tuning parameter |
| Binomial  | ![](./assets/images/binom.png) | Gives you the probability of getting k "success" in n iterations/trials

Lastly, we will introduce the Beta function, which will be a critical tool to add to our Bayesian reportoire this week.

#### Requirements
We're going to be dealing with some theoretical material, which is required to understand the foundations of statistics. Therefore, you'll need to review some of the basic counting identities. 

For the small code snippet on coin-tosses, you may want to take a few minutes first to [review this video from Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ab-sixth-grade-math/al-statistics-probability/al-probability/v/coin-flipping-example). It gives a great overview of the problem statement, as well as a good work-through of some potential solutions. 

**Bonus:**
- Look up [Fisher's exact test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test), which will show you a more substantive example of the link between counting and statistics. Try to derive the exact test yourself with some basic counting principles.
